          <h2>About Me</h2>
       
<article>   

    <p> Hello! I'm Maura, owner of <em>3two9 image & design</em>. 
    I'm a native of Tacoma, Washington.
    As one of 6 kids, I loved documenting family functions from an early age.
    I currently live in Port Orchard, with my husband of 20 years and 2 busy sons.</p>
    
    <p>Even though I've always had a camera in hand as long as I can remember, 
    I started taking photography seriously 2 years ago after my best friend
    of 30 years passed away from pancreatic cancer. Her advice to me was
    <em>"Don't wait. Whatever you want to do, try or accomplish....don't wait. Use your talent. Be happy."</em>
    I think she would be proud to know I actually listened.</p>

    <p> I currently photograph <b>weddings</b>, highschool <b>seniors</b>, <b>sports</b> and <b>families</b> and hope to start
    including my passion for dentistry by doing <b>staff photos</b> for local offices. Don't see what you are looking to have
    photographed? Just ask!
    </p>

    <p> I also do photo/video tributes and presentations for family, businesses and events.<p>

    <p> Need a high volume of photos scanned? I do that too!</p>
